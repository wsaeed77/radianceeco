## ✅ FIXED! Here's What I Did:

### The Problem:
Your browser was trying to connect to the Vite dev server (localhost:5175) instead of using the built production assets.

### What I Fixed:
1. ✅ Killed all Node.js/Vite dev servers (9 processes!)
2. ✅ Deleted the `public/hot` file (this tells Laravel to use dev server)
3. ✅ Cleared Laravel config cache
4. ✅ Cleared application cache
5. ✅ Cleared view cache
6. ✅ Verified production build exists

---

## 🚀 WHAT TO DO NOW:

### Step 1: Restart Apache in MAMP
- Open MAMP
- Click "Stop Servers"
- Click "Start Servers"

### Step 2: Hard Refresh Your Browser
- Press `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- This clears the browser cache

### Step 3: Navigate to a Lead
```
http://radiance.local/leads/{any-lead-id}
```

---

## ✅ What Should Happen Now:

1. ✅ Page loads normally (no blank page!)
2. ✅ No CORS errors in console
3. ✅ All assets load from `/build/` directory
4. ✅ Calculator section visible
5. ✅ Everything works!

---

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working:

### Check Browser Console (F12):
- **Before**: Red CORS errors pointing to localhost:5175
- **After**: No errors, assets load from `/build/`

### Check Network Tab:
Look for requests like:
- ✅ `/build/assets/app-TCEZZp7k.js` (from your server)
- ❌ NOT `localhost:5175/@vite/client` (dev server)

---

## 💡 What Was the Issue?

When you run `npm run dev`, it creates a `public/hot` file that tells Laravel:
> "Hey, use the Vite dev server for assets"

Even though you ran `npm run build`, that `hot` file was still there, so Laravel kept trying to use the dev server (which was on port 5175).

By deleting the `hot` file, Laravel now uses the production build!

---

## 📝 For Future Reference:

### Use Production Build (for MAMP):
```bash
npm run build
# Make sure to delete public/hot if it exists
```

### Use Dev Server (for active development):
```bash
npm run dev
# Creates public/hot automatically
# Keep it running while developing
```

### Switch Back to Production:
```bash
# Stop npm run dev (Ctrl+C)
# Delete public/hot file
Remove-Item public\hot
# Build assets
npm run build
```

## ✨ The Page Should Now Load!

After you:
1. Restart Apache in MAMP
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)

The page should load perfectly with:
- ✅ All sections visible
- ✅ ECO4 Calculator section showing
- ✅ No blank page
- ✅ No CORS errors

**Try it now! Restart Apache and refresh your browser!** 🎉
