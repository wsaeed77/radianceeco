# 🎉 ECO4 Calculator - Now Live on Lead Page!

## ✅ What I Just Did

1. ✅ Added import for `Eco4CalculatorCard` component
2. ✅ Added calculator section to Lead Show page (after EPC section)
3. ✅ Started frontend build (`npm run dev`)

---

## 📍 Where to Find It

### Navigate to Any Lead:
```
http://radiance.local/leads/{lead-id}
```

### Scroll Down:
The calculator appears **right after the EPC section** and **before the Activity Thread**.

Look for the section with:
- 🧮 Green header
- Title: "ECO4/GBIS Calculator"

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Pick a Lead with EPC Data
1. Go to any lead that has EPC data already fetched
2. Or fetch EPC data first using the "Fetch EPC Report" button

### Step 2: Use the Calculator
1. **Scheme**: Select GBIS or ECO4
2. **SAP Band**: Should auto-populate from EPC! (e.g., "High_D")
3. **Floor Area**: Should auto-populate from EPC! (e.g., "0-72")
4. **Measures**: Select one or more measures
   - Example: Check "CWI_0.040" (Cavity Wall Insulation)
5. Click **"Calculate"**

### Step 3: See Results
You should see:
- ✅ Total ABS (Annual Bill Savings)
- ✅ Total ECO Value (in £)
- ✅ Individual measure breakdown
- ✅ "Save Calculation to Lead" button

## 📊 Example Test

### Test with These Values:
- **Scheme**: GBIS
- **SAP Band**: High_D
- **Floor Area**: 0-72
- **Measure**: CWI_0.040

### Expected Result:
```
Total ABS: 64.9
Total ECO Value: £1,395.35
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the calculator"
1. Wait for `npm run dev` to finish building (30-60 seconds)
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check browser console for any errors (F12)

### "No measures showing"
1. The measures are loaded from the database
2. Verify data import: `php artisan test:eco4-calculator`
3. Check that 21,804 scores are imported

### "Auto-populate not working"
1. Make sure the lead has EPC data first
2. Click "Fetch EPC Report" button in the EPC section
3. The calculator will auto-populate SAP band and floor area

### "Calculate button not working"
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for any JavaScript errors
3. Check that all fields are filled:
   - SAP Band selected
   - Floor Area selected
   - At least one measure selected

## 📖 Quick Reference

### API Endpoints (if you want to test directly):
```bash
# Get metadata
curl http://radiance.local/api/eco4/metadata

# Calculate
curl -X POST http://radiance.local/api/eco4/calculate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scheme": "GBIS",
    "starting_sap_band": "High_D",
    "floor_area_band": "0-72",
    "measures": [{"type": "CWI_0.040", "percentage_treated": 100}]
  }'
```

### Test Calculator Service:
```bash
php artisan test:eco4-calculator
```

### Check Database:
```bash
php artisan tinker
```
```php
echo \App\Models\Eco4PartialScore::count() . " ECO4 Partial\n";
echo \App\Models\GbisPartialScore::count() . " GBIS Partial\n";
echo \App\Models\Eco4FullScore::count() . " ECO4 Full\n";
```

## 📱 Browser Support

The calculator works on:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest)
- ✅ Mobile browsers

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Auto-Calculate
The calculator remembers your selections, so you can quickly test different measures.

### Tip 2: Multiple Measures
Select multiple measures to see combined ECO value:
- CWI_0.040 + Loft_Insulation_0.16 = Combined value

### Tip 3: Save Calculations
Save calculations to keep a record of different scenarios for each lead.

### Tip 4: Compare Schemes
Calculate the same measures in both GBIS and ECO4 to compare values.

## 🎓 Understanding the Results

### ABS (Annual Bill Savings)
- The cost savings value from the Ofgem lookup table
- Based on property characteristics and measure type

### PPS Points
- ABS × PPS ECO Rate (default: 21.5)
- Used by Ofgem to calculate scheme compliance

### ECO Value
- PPS Points × Innovation Multiplier (default: 1.0)
- The final value in pounds (£)
- This is what the measure is "worth"
