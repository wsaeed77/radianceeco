## 🔧 Issue Fixed

### Middleware Error Resolution
**Error**: `Target class [Spatie\Permission\Middlewares\PermissionMiddleware] does not exist.`

**Solution**: Updated `app/Http/Kernel.php` line 69-70
- Changed: `Spatie\Permission\Middlewares\` (plural)
- To: `Spatie\Permission\Middleware\` (singular)

This is due to namespace changes in Spatie Permission v5+

$user->assignRole('admin');
exit
```

## 🛠️ Maintenance Commands

```bash
# If routes not working
php artisan route:clear
php artisan ziggy:generate
npm run build

# If permissions not applying
php artisan permission:cache-reset
php artisan cache:clear

# If you modify permissions
php artisan db:seed --class=ComprehensivePermissionSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=UpdatedRoleSeeder

# View all routes
php artisan route:list --path=users
php artisan route:list --path=permissions
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Roles Primarily**: Assign roles to users and only add individual permissions when absolutely necessary

2. **Test with Non-Admin**: Always test features with Agent/Manager roles to ensure permissions work correctly

3. **Document Custom Permissions**: If you add new permissions, document them in the seeder

4. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review user permissions and remove unnecessary access

5. **Backup Before Changes**: Always backup database before modifying role permissions
