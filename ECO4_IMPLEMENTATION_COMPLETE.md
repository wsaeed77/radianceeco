## 🧮 How the Calculator Works

### Calculation Flow

```
User Input:
├── Scheme (GBIS/ECO4)
├── Starting SAP Band (e.g., "High_D")
├── Floor Area Band (e.g., "0-72")
├── Pre-heating Source (optional)
└── Selected Measures []
    ├── Measure Type
    ├── Percentage Treated (0-100%)
    └── Innovation Flag (yes/no)

↓

Calculator Service:
├── For each measure:
│   ├── Query database (eco4_partial_scores or gbis_partial_scores)
│   ├── Match by: measure_type, floor_area, SAP band, heating source
│   ├── Get: cost_savings from matched row
│   ├── Calculate: ABS = cost_savings × (percentage/100)
│   ├── Calculate: PPS = ABS × pps_eco_rate (default: 21.5)
│   └── Calculate: ECO Value = PPS × innovation_multiplier
└── Sum all measures → Total ABS, Total ECO Value

↓

Output:
├── Summary
│   ├── Total ABS: £X.XX
│   └── Total ECO Value: £X.XX
└── Measures []
    ├── Measure Type
    ├── ABS Value
    ├── PPS Points
    └── ECO Value
```

## 🎨 UI Enhancements (Next Steps)

The current starter component works but is basic. To match CoreLogic:

### 1. Card-Based Measure Selection
Instead of checkboxes, use cards with:
- Measure icon/image
- Measure name
- Color-coded category
- Add/Remove button

### 2. Visual SAP Band Selector
Color-coded buttons instead of dropdown:
- G = Red
- F = Orange
- E = Yellow
- D = Light Green
- C = Green
- B = Dark Green
- A = Blue

### 3. Measure Details Expansion
For each measure, add:
- Slider for percentage treated
- Innovation checkbox
- Post-heating source selector
- Variant selector

### 4. Real-Time Calculation
Remove "Calculate" button, update automatically on input change (with debouncing).

### 5. Results Enhancement
- Larger, more prominent totals
- Animated counters
- Charts/graphs
- Comparison view

### 6. Advanced Features
- Save/name calculations
- List of saved calculations
- PDF export/quote generation
- Email quotes
- Measure templates

## 🎓 How to Maintain

### Add New Measures
When Ofgem releases new scores:
1. Download new Excel/CSV files
2. Place in `storage/ofgem_files/`
3. Run: `php artisan ofgem:convert` (if Excel)
4. Run: `php artisan ofgem:import --fresh`

### Update Calculator Logic
Edit: `app/Services/Eco4CalculatorService.php`

All calculation logic is in one service class for easy maintenance.

### Update API
Edit: `app/Http/Controllers/Api/Eco4CalculatorController.php`

All API logic is in one controller.

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### 1. Measure Type Names
The measure type names in the database are **exactly as they appear in Ofgem files**. Examples:
- `CWI_0.040` (not "Cavity Wall Insulation")
- `Loft_Insulation_0.16`
- `Park_Home_Wall_Insulation_0.030`

Use the metadata endpoint to get exact names:
```javascript
const metadata = await axios.get('/api/eco4/metadata');
const measures = metadata.measures.gbis; // or .eco4
```

### 2. SAP Band Variants
Each SAP band (A-G) has two variants:
- `Low_D` - Lower half of the band
- `High_D` - Upper half of the band

Determine variant based on exact SAP score.

### 3. Full Project vs. Partial
- **Partial:** Calculate individual measures, sum them up (most common)
- **Full:** Lookup pre-calculated score based on before/after SAP bands

### 4. Innovation Measures
Innovation measures get a multiplier (default 1.0, can be higher):
```javascript
eco_value = pps_points * innovation_multiplier
```
