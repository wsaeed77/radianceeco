## Technical Details

### Fixed Authentication Issue

The problem was with how the API credentials were being sent:

**Before (Not Working):**
```php
Http::withBasicAuth($entire_key_with_colon, '')
```

**After (Working):**
```php
// Split email:password and send separately
list($username, $password) = explode(':', $apiKey, 2);
Http::withBasicAuth($username, $password)
```

### Files Modified

1. **`app/Services/EpcApiService.php`**
   - Fixed authentication to properly split username and password
   - Cleaned up debug logging

2. **`app/Http/Controllers/EpcController.php`**
   - Handles fetch and clear operations

3. **`app/Models/Lead.php`**
   - Added `epc_data` and `epc_fetched_at` fields

4. **`routes/web.php`**
   - Added EPC routes

5. **`resources/js/Pages/Leads/Show.jsx`**
   - Added comprehensive EPC display section

6. **`config/services.php`**
   - Added EPC configuration

7. **Database Migration**
   - Added EPC fields to leads table

### Testing Command

You can test the EPC API anytime with:
```bash
php artisan test:epc MK125AN
```

Or with any other UK postcode:
```bash
php artisan test:epc SW1A1AA
php artisan test:epc MK93AY
```

## Usage Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Fetch Once:** EPC data doesn't change frequently (certificates valid for 10 years), so fetch once and store
2. **Refresh:** Use the "Refresh" button if you need updated data
3. **Clear:** Use "Clear EPC Data" if you want to remove stored data
4. **Postcode Format:** Works with or without spaces (e.g., "MK12 5AN" or "MK125AN")

### Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: No EPC Found**
- Property may not have an EPC certificate
- Postcode might be incorrect
- Property might be exempt (some property types don't require EPCs)

**Scenario 2: Multiple Certificates**
- The system automatically shows the most recent certificate
- Older certificates are also fetched (up to 5) in case needed

**Scenario 3: Incomplete Address**
- If only postcode is available, system searches by postcode only
- If door number is available, it's included for more accurate matching

## API Limits

The UK Government EPC API has rate limits:
- **Free Tier:** ~500 requests per day
- **Response Time:** Usually 1-3 seconds
- **Availability:** 99%+ uptime

## Troubleshooting

### If EPC Fetch Fails:

1. **Check Postcode:** Ensure it's a valid UK postcode
2. **Check Logs:** View `storage/logs/laravel.log` for detailed errors
3. **Test Command:** Run `php artisan test:epc POSTCODE` to test directly
4. **API Status:** Check https://epc.opendatacommunities.org/ for service status

### If You Get 401 Error:

1. Verify `.env` has: `EPC_API_KEY=email:password`
2. Run: `php artisan config:clear`
3. Ensure credentials are correct (no spaces, no quotes)

## Security Notes

- âœ… API key stored securely in `.env` (not in version control)
- âœ… All EPC endpoints require authentication
- âœ… No sensitive data exposed to frontend
- âœ… All API calls logged for monitoring

## Performance

- **Database Storage:** EPC data cached in database (not fetched every page load)
- **JSON Format:** Efficient storage and retrieval
- **Lazy Loading:** Only fetches when user clicks button
- **Fast Display:** Pre-formatted data for quick rendering

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Auto-fetch:** Automatically fetch EPC when postcode is entered
2. **Bulk Fetch:** Add ability to fetch EPC for multiple leads
3. **Alerts:** Notify when EPC certificates are expiring
4. **Reports:** Add EPC data to analytics dashboard
5. **Export:** Export EPC data to PDF or Excel

## Support

For issues:
- **API Problems:** Check https://epc.opendatacommunities.org/
- **Application Issues:** Check logs at `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- **Test Connection:** Use `php artisan test:epc POSTCODE`

## Summary

âœ… **Status:** Fully Operational  
âœ… **API Authentication:** Working  
âœ… **Data Retrieval:** Successful  
âœ… **UI Display:** Complete  
âœ… **Database Storage:** Implemented
