## What Works Right Now ✅

### You Can Currently:
1. ✅ Call API endpoints from Postman/Insomnia
2. ✅ Calculate GBIS scores
3. ✅ Calculate ECO4 scores
4. ✅ Calculate full project scores
5. ✅ Save calculations to leads
6. ✅ Retrieve saved calculations
7. ✅ Delete calculations
8. ✅ Get all metadata (dropdowns)
9. ✅ Test from command line
10. ✅ Import the React component

### Example - Working API Call:
```bash
curl -X POST http://radiance.local/api/eco4/calculate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scheme": "GBIS",
    "starting_sap_band": "High_D",
    "floor_area_band": "0-72",
    "measures": [{"type": "CWI_0.040", "percentage_treated": 100}]
  }'
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "summary": {
    "total_abs": 64.9,
    "total_eco_value": 1395.35
  },
  "measures": [...]
}
```

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Verify Backend
```bash
php artisan test:eco4-calculator
```
**Expected:** All tests pass ✅

### Step 2: Add to Lead Page
Edit `resources/js/Pages/Leads/Show.jsx`:
```jsx
import Eco4CalculatorCard from '@/Components/Eco4CalculatorCard';

// In JSX (after EPC section):
<Eco4CalculatorCard lead={lead} />
```

### Step 3: Build Assets
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test
Navigate to: `http://radiance.local/leads/{any-lead-id}`

**Expected:** See ECO4 Calculator section ✅
