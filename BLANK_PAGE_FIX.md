## üîß Quick Fix for Blank Page

I've fixed the import error in the `Eco4CalculatorCard.jsx` component. The issue was:

**Problem:**
```jsx
import { Card, ... } from './Card';  // ‚ùå Wrong
```

**Fixed:**
```jsx
import Card, { ... } from '@/Components/Card';  // ‚úÖ Correct
```

## ‚ö° What to Do Now

### Option 1: Wait for Build (Recommended)
1. Wait for `npm run dev` to finish (should show "‚úì built in...")
2. Refresh your browser: `Ctrl+F5` (hard refresh)
3. The page should load normally

### Option 2: Manual Restart
If the build is stuck:

1. **Stop the build**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal
2. **Start fresh**: Run `npm run dev` again
3. **Wait**: Look for "‚úì built in..." message
4. **Refresh**: Hard refresh your browser (`Ctrl+F5`)

## üìä About the CORS Errors

The CORS errors you see are **expected** and **not a problem**. Here's why:

### What's Happening:
- Browser tries to preflight the `/api/eco4/metadata` request
- The API requires authentication (Sanctum)
- Preflight request fails because no session yet
- **But the actual request will work once the page loads**

### These Are Normal:
- `CORS error` on `client` - Browser attempting to load resources
- `CORS error` on `app.jsx` - React components being loaded
- `CORS error` on `@react-refresh` - Development hot reload

### What's Important:
- The page should load once the build completes
- The calculator will be visible (even if metadata fails initially)
- Once you're logged in, the API calls will work

## ‚úÖ Steps to Verify It's Working

### Step 1: Check Terminal
Look for this message:
```
‚úì built in XXXms
```

### Step 2: Refresh Browser
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- The blank page should be gone

### Step 3: Navigate to a Lead
```
http://radiance.local/leads/{any-lead-id}
```

### Step 4: Scroll Down
You should see the ECO4 Calculator section (even if it shows a loading spinner for metadata)

## üö® If Page is Still Blank

### Check Browser Console (F12)
Look for actual JavaScript errors (not CORS warnings).

### Common Issues:

**Issue 1: Build Process Not Complete**
- Solution: Wait for build, then refresh

**Issue 2: Cached Assets**
- Solution: Clear browser cache or hard refresh

**Issue 3: Syntax Error**
- Check browser console for red errors
- Look for file/line number

## üí° Temporary Workaround

If you want to see the page working immediately without the calculator:

### Remove the Calculator Temporarily:

Edit `resources/js/Pages/Leads/Show.jsx` and comment out:

```jsx
{/* ECO4/GBIS Calculator */}
{/* <Eco4CalculatorCard lead={lead} /> */}
```

This will let you see the page while we fix any remaining issues.

## üéØ Expected Behavior

Once working, you should see:

1. ‚úÖ Page loads normally
2. ‚úÖ All sections visible (Lead Info, EPC, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ New section: "üßÆ ECO4/GBIS Calculator"
4. ‚úÖ Calculator shows "Loading calculator..." initially
5. ‚úÖ Then shows form fields once metadata loads

---

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Wait** for `npm run dev` to complete
2. **Refresh** your browser (hard refresh)
3. **Check** if the page loads
4. **Let me know** if you still see a blank page

If it's still blank after refreshing, send me:
- Any red errors from browser console (F12)
- The terminal output when build completes

**The fix is applied - just waiting for the build to complete!** üöÄ
