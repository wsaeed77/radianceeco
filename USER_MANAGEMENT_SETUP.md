## 📝 Usage Examples

### Checking Permissions in Code

**In Controllers:**
```php
// Method 1: Check permission
if (Auth::user()->can('lead.create')) {
    // User can create leads
}

// Method 2: Using middleware
Route::get('/users', [UserController::class, 'index'])
    ->middleware('permission:user.view');
```

**In Blade Templates:**
```blade
@can('user.create')
    <button>Create User</button>
@endcan
```

### Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Add a New Agent**
1. Go to Users > New User
2. Set Role: Agent
3. Agent automatically gets: view own leads, create activities, upload documents

**Scenario 2: Promote Agent to Manager**
1. Go to Users > Find Agent > Edit
2. Change Role from "Agent" to "Manager"
3. Save - They instantly get all manager permissions

**Scenario 3: Give Extra Permission to Agent**
1. Edit the agent user
2. Scroll to "Additional Permissions"
3. Check specific permissions (e.g., "Export" from Data Operations)
4. Save - Agent now has export ability in addition to agent role permissions

## 🛠️ Maintenance Commands

```bash
# Clear permission cache
php artisan permission:cache-reset

# View all permissions
php artisan permission:show

# Reseed permissions (if you add new ones)
php artisan db:seed --class=ComprehensivePermissionSeeder

# Reseed roles (if you modify role permissions)
php artisan db:seed --class=UpdatedRoleSeeder

# Clear route cache and regenerate
php artisan route:clear
php artisan ziggy:generate
npm run build
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **First User Setup**: If you haven't assigned roles to your existing admin user:
   ```bash
   php artisan tinker
   $user = User::where('email', 'your-admin@email.com')->first();
   $user->assignRole('admin');
   ```

2. **Route Access**: All users management routes are protected by permissions:
   - Viewing users requires: `user.view`
   - Creating users requires: `user.create`
   - Editing users requires: `user.edit`
   - Deleting users requires: `user.delete`

3. **Legacy Support**: The old `/agents` route still works for backward compatibility

- `USER_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete documentation with all permissions
- `REPORTS_FEATURE.md` - Reports system documentation
- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md` - Google Drive integration guide

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Assign Role to Your Account**:
   ```bash
   php artisan tinker
   User::find(1)->assignRole('admin');
   ```

2. **Test the System**:
   - Log in with admin account
   - Visit `/users`
   - Create a test agent user
   - Try different permission combinations

3. **Customize If Needed**:
   - Add new permissions in `ComprehensivePermissionSeeder.php`
   - Modify role permissions in `UpdatedRoleSeeder.php`
   - Run seeders to apply changes

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Route 'users.index' not found"**
```bash
php artisan route:clear
php artisan ziggy:generate
npm run build
```

**"Permission denied" errors**
```bash
php artisan permission:cache-reset
php artisan cache:clear
```

**Permissions not showing**
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=ComprehensivePermissionSeeder
```
