  - Automatic retry logic for failed requests

#### Controller
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/EpcController.php`
- Created dedicated controller for EPC operations
- Endpoints:
  - `POST /leads/{lead}/epc/fetch` - Fetch EPC certificate
  - `DELETE /leads/{lead}/epc` - Clear stored EPC data
- Includes authentication middleware

## Configuration Required

Add to `.env` file:

```env
# EPC API Configuration
EPC_API_URL=https://epc.opendatacommunities.org/api/v1
EPC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## How to Get API Key

1. Visit: https://epc.opendatacommunities.org/
2. Register for a free account
3. Navigate to "API Access"

2. **Test with invalid postcode:**
   - Use a fake postcode
   - Verify error message is shown

3. **Test without API key:**
   - Remove API key from .env
   - Verify appropriate error message

4. **Test refresh functionality:**
   - Fetch data
   - Modify some lead data
   - Click refresh
   - Verify updated data is shown

5. **Test clear functionality:**
   - Fetch data
   - Click "Clear EPC Data"
   - Verify data is cleared and empty state is shown

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Bulk EPC Fetch:** Add ability to fetch EPC for multiple leads at once
2. **EPC Alerts:** Notify when EPC certificates are expiring (10-year validity)
3. **EPC Reports:** Generate PDF reports from EPC data
4. **Historical EPC Data:** Store multiple versions of EPC certificates
5. **EPC Recommendations:** Display and track improvement recommendations
6. **EPC Comparison:** Compare multiple properties' EPC ratings
7. **EPC Analytics:** Add EPC data to reporting dashboards
8. **Auto-fetch:** Automatically fetch EPC when postcode is entered
9. **EPC Validation:** Validate leads are eligible based on EPC ratings
10. **EPC Export:** Export EPC data to Excel/CSV

## Known Limitations

1. **API Dependency:** Relies on UK Government API availability
2. **Rate Limits:** Subject to API rate limits (usually 500 requests/day for free tier)
3. **Data Accuracy:** Data accuracy depends on assessor input
4. **Coverage:** Only works for properties in UK with registered EPCs
5. **Historical Data:** API only returns most recent certificate by default
6. **Address Matching:** May require exact address format for successful match
